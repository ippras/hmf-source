HMTs had 1.3–5.3% MA, 17.0–24.4% PA, 3.9–7.4% SA and 30.3–41.2% SFAs. Although MA, PA and SA had different chemical structures in the carbon chain numbers, they showed the similar nutritional characteristics for infants [11,15,20,21].

* G1 (fatty acid of TAG)
* G2 (fatty acid at the sn-2 position)

* Bi - TAG (wt%)
* Di - TAG mean

* Bi(sn-2) - MAG2
* Di(sn-2) MAG2 mean

B = 0.24

Ci = (Bi - Ai) / Ai
C = (0.24 - A) / A = 0.54
(1.64 - 1.66)/1.66=-0.012048192771084337349

a = if B < A.start {
    A.start
} else B > A.end {
    A.end
} else {
    B
};

When B is higher than the upper limit of the corresponding fatty acid content, A was selected as the upper limit of the range.
If B was lower than the lower limit of the range, the lower limit was given as A.
If the values of B were within the range, floating rate (C) was kept at zero.

FA:: Fatty acid
IQR:: Interquartile range
P:: P-value, significant difference
RR:: Reference range (Range)

Reference range:: the difference between the highest and lowest values
Interquartile range:: the range of the middle half of a distribution
Standard deviation:: average distance from the mean
